<H1>HOTGAME House and Techno Analysis</H1>
<p>This is an explorative study of the <span style="color:#0ef817";>HO</span>use and <span style="color:#0ef817";>T</span>echno from <span style="color:#3433ff";>G</span>ermany and <span style="color:#f80e0e";>AME</span>rica (HOTGAME) using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM):</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <a href="technomaps/2025-02-24-med-bpm-phsp-chacorr-crest-USvsGer.html" target="_blank">Nations Map</a> shows that German and US-American house and techno music are different</li>
	<li>The <a href="technomaps/2025-02-24-med-bpm-phsp-chacorr-crest-Nation-Years.html" target="_blank">Years Map</a> shows that early German music emulated the US-sound, but established various new sounds between 1992 and 1994.
	</li>
	<li>The <a href="technomaps/2025-02-24-med-bpm-phsp-chacorr-crest-Genres.html" target="_blank">Styles Map</a> shows that most house and techno tracks from the US are much alike (like acid house, Chicago house, deep house, the first wave of Detroit techno, garage, hip house), while German styles are different (like breakbeat, Eurodance, hardtrance, tekkno, trance). German downbeat, house and hardcore are almost identical to their American counterpart.

</ul>
<p>These observations, discussed in relationship to narratives about the development of the scenes, provide evidence why techno became a mass phenomenon in Germany, but not in the United States: The German music had a larger variety and progressed over time. This helped matching many people's taste and keep the movement alive.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14958955" target="_blank">HOTGAME dataset of early house and techno music from Germany and America</a> is available online. The corpus does not contain any audio material, but descriptive recording studio features. The <a href="https://github.com/ifsm/HOTGAME-feature-extraction" target="_blank">recording studio feature extraction code</a> is also available online. The SOM and the analysis code can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/ifsm/Techno-Analysis" target="_blank">Techno-Analysis</a> project page. &copy Tim Ziemer 2025</p>
